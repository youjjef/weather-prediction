# weather-prediction
 a model to predict the TOURS_temp_max of the next day using only the data of the previous days.
 used 3 models to compare between their results: RNN and its two variations GRU and LSTM.
# Based on the results table, we can draw the following conclusions:

```


1. For step size 5, the LSTM model achieved the lowest validation loss of 3.871215, followed closely by the GRU model with a validation loss of 3.947829. The RNN model had the highest validation loss of 4.331570. Therefore, the LSTM model performed the best for step size 5.

2. For step size 10, the LSTM model again achieved the lowest validation loss of 3.775806, followed by the RNN model with a validation loss of 3.923290 and the GRU model with a validation loss of 3.984897. Therefore, the LSTM model performed the best for step size 10 as well.

3. For step size 20, the LSTM model achieved the lowest validation loss of 3.776256, followed by the GRU model with a validation loss of 3.964073 and the RNN model with a validation loss of 4.027072. Therefore, the LSTM model performed the best for step size 20 as well.

4. In terms of the effect of early stopping, we can see that for all step sizes and models, early stopping was triggered before the maximum number of epochs was reached. This suggests that early stopping was effective in preventing overfitting and improving the generalization performance of the models.

5. Overall, the LSTM model performed the best across all step sizes, achieving the lowest validation loss for each step size. Therefore, if we had to choose one model to use for this task, the LSTM model would be the best choice.

6. In terms of step size, we can see that smaller step sizes (5 and 10) generally resulted in lower validation losses for all models. This suggests that using smaller step sizes can improve the performance of the models. However, it is important to note that smaller step sizes also result in longer sequences, which can increase the computational complexity of the models and make them more difficult to train.

In summary, the LSTM model performed the best for all step sizes, and using smaller step sizes generally resulted in better performance. Early stopping was effective in preventing overfitting and improving the generalization performance of the models.
